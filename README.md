The website incorporates earthy tones (brown, beige, gold) and royal hues like deep red and green. It uses classic serif fonts such as Times New Roman and Old English Text for a traditional look. Icons are hand-drawn in a vintage style, and backgrounds feature subtle textures resembling aged parchment or wood grain.
